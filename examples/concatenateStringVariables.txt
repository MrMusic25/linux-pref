If you want to combine string variables into one big string, you must concatenate (combine) them.
e.g If you want to combine the options for a command, then call it all at once

Note the whitespace in front of the "options" It is necessary if you wish to do things this way, as are the quotation 
marks.

Script looks like:

#!/bin/bash
# scriptTest.sh - A script for testing theories and code snippets

source commonFunctions.sh

options="empty"
option1=" -a"
option2=" --no-output"

echo "Option: $options"
options="$options""$option1"
echo "With option 1: $options"
options="$options""$option2"
echo "With option 2: $options"

#EOF

Output looks like:

Option: empty
With option 1: empty -a
With option 2: empty -a --no-output
