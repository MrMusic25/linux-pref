This will demonstrate how win2UnixPath() is meant to be used for Bash on Windows

Script looks like:

#!/bin/bash
#
# Script used to test functions and ideas before putting it into production

source commonFunctions.sh

file="G:\iTunes\iTunes Media\Music\Die Antwoord\Donker Mag\1-07 Cookie Thumper!.mp3"

echo "Original: $file"
echo " "

prefix="/mnt" # Main use: Bash on Windows
echo "Editing file with prefix of: $prefix"
newFile="$(win2UnixPath "$file")"

echo "New file looks like: $newFile"
echo " "

printf "Does path exist?: "
if [[ -e "$newFile" ]]; then
	printf "True\n\n"
else
	printf "False\n\n"
fi

printf "Is path a file?: "
if [[ -f "$newFile" ]]; then
	printf "True\n\n"
else
	printf "False\n\n"
fi

cutFile="$(echo "$newFile" | rev | cut -d'/' -f 1 --complement | rev)"
echo "New cut file looks like: $cutFile"
echo " "

printf "Does path exist?: "
if [[ -e "$cutFile" ]]; then
	printf "True\n\n"
else
	printf "False\n\n"
fi

printf "Is path a directory?: "
if [[ -d "$cutFile" ]]; then
	printf "True\n\n"
else
	printf "False\n\n"
fi
