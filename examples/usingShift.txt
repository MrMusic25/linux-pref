An example on how the 'shift' command works.

The script looks like:

#!/bin/bash
# Script used to test functionality of functions and others from commonFunctions.sh

source commonFunctions.sh

function testing123() {
	echo "This is what it looks like right now:"
	echo "$@"
	echo "This is what 0-arg comes back as: $0"
	shift
	echo "Now, after a shift, @ looks like:"
	echo "$@"
}

testing123 "disappear" "$@"

#EOF

When './scriptTest.sh ok working now' is run, this is the output:

This is what it looks like right now:
disappear ok working now
This is what 0-arg comes back as: ./scriptTest.sh
Now, after a shift, @ looks like:
ok working now
