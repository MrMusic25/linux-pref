# Programs useful for mining, based on coin desired

## ethereum
# Recommended: Download ethminer from https://github.com/ethereum-mining/ethminer.git and compile from source using cmake/make
make
cmake
g++

# Uncomment below if you will be using OpenCL. Skip the next block if so
#opencl-mesa

# Next, install CUDA toolkit (if running NVIDIA graphics cards). Download the latest client from the following link
#   https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit
# Then, run the following command in the downloaded directory
#   sudo ./cuda_*.run 
# Install the driver and toolkit at the minimum. If the installation gives you trouble, disable the desktop manager and then install (press CTRL+ALT+F1 to use a terminal)

# After installing above, run the following commands:
#   git clone https://github.com/ethereum-mining/ethminer.git
#   cd ethminer/
#   mkdir build && cd build
#   cmake .. -DETHASHCUDA=ON (NOTE: You can run just 'cmake ..' if you will be using OpenCL)
#   cmake --build .
#   sudo make install
# You can then run ethminer from anywhere. Run 'ethminer --help' to decide what options are best for you

## Gridcoin
# If you do not have something like an AUR, you will need to compile from source (find directions at http://www.gridcoin.us/Guides/gridcoin-install.htm)
# For Debian/Ubuntu users, you can add from ppa using the following commands
#   sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
#   sudo add-apt-repository ppa:gridcoin/gridcoin-stable 
#   sudo apt-get update
# Then, you can run the following section
boinc
gridcoinresearchd
gridcoinresearch-qt

# Make sure you setup boinc BEFORE running the gridcoin wallet!
