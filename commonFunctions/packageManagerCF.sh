# packageManagerCF.sh - Common functions for package managers and similar functions
#
# Changes:
# v0.0.1
# - Updated to-do
# - Initial version
#
# TODO:
# - determinePM()
#   ~ If $packageManager is present in .bashrc, return and continue; else:
#     ~ Create array of all package managers
#     ~ Ask user to choose which package manager to use
#       ~ If only one present, confirm with user to use it (should only be one anyways)
#     ~ Export variable packageManager="$pm" to .bashrc, to save time later
#   ~ Separate updating databases from this function
#   ~ In cases like Arch with pacman/yaourt, inform user of dual-package managers
