Decided one day to clean up the increasingly-lengthy changlogs at the beginning of each script.
NOW, only the last three major versions will be kept in the changelog. The rest will go here for history!

commonFunctions.sh
# v1.8.1
# - The best kind of updates are those that go untested, amirite? Lol, bug fixes
# - Added a newline so text doesn't get chopped
#
# v1.8.0
# - getUserAnswer() can now assume yes/no ans timeout for "headless" scripts. Doesn't effect legacy calls.
#
# v1.7.6
# - Moved checkRequirements() to pmCF.sh
# - Added a source argument for pmCF.sh
# - Fixed SC2145
#
# v1.7.5
# - A comment required a version change... Script now relies on $program not being set
# - Added as close to an '#ifndef' statement as I could for sourcing
#
# v1.7.4
# - Debug now supports levels! See function for more info (legacy calls are not effected)
#
# v1.7.3
# - Didn't want to change major version since I was working on it today
# - Added function editTextFile() that was originally built for improved programInstaller.sh
#
# v1.7.2
# - Don't use pipes to separate variables... Changed to slashes, and this time I tested before uploading
# - Small change to determinePM() to prevent pacman errors
# - After testing, reverted the change to determinePM and moved it to universalInstaller()
#
# v1.7.1
# - Fixed checkRequirements() so it accepts "program|installer" as an argument
#
# v1.7.0
# - Added checkRequirements()
#
# v1.6.7
# - Added a very tiny function that pauses the script (can't believe it took me this long to do something so simple...)
# - Fixed a few issues found with shellcheck
#
# v1.6.6
# - Changed the way updating and installing with pacman works
#
# v1.6.5
# - Fixed determinePM() so 'which' is not so noisy
# - Added some more debug statements
# - Changed the way determinePrivilege() works due to a bug I discovered
# - BIG (yet humble) CHANGE: debug() now redirects message to stderr instead of stdout if verbose is on
#
# v1.6.4
# - Found a huge error in debug(), fixed now
# - Fixed all errors from shellcheck (minus the ones that don't need fixing (SC2034) and ones that would break the functions)
# - So many small changes I forgot to list
#
# v1.6.3
# - checkPrivilege() now returns 0 if you are root and 777 if not
# - Quick fix to universalInstaller() for apt-get, assumes yes for installation
#
# v1.6.2
# - Added small 'function' that allows any script to have -v|--verbose as $1 to enable debugging
# - Change to the way addCronJob() works, since it was non-functional before
#
# v1.6.1
# - Finally got around to testing getUserAnswer, and it only half worked. Now works 97%.
# - Other small changes I forgot to document and forgot hours later
#
# v1.6.0
# - Big update - now, all scripts have a dynamically assigned logFile based on the script name!
# - All scripts have been updated to reflect this, they can still be found in '$HOME/.logs'
# - MAJOR update to announce(), now looks much cleaner!
# - announce() now checks to make sure an argument is given as well

# - Added slackpkg to universalInstaller() and determinePM()
#
# v1.5.0

#
# v1.4.0
# - Added a re-run as sudo option to update.sh, then decided to make is common as part of checkPrivilege()

#
# v1.3.0

# - Added variable for a log directory prefix; small line, big impact

#
# v1.2.1
